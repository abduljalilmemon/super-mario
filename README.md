Upon completion of Level 1, players are prompted to press the space bar to enter Level 2. In Level 2, an enemy known as the Goomba dynamically moves between hurdles. If the Mario character touches the Goomba on the x-axis, it results in Mario's demise, reducing the number of hearts. The player is then returned to the starting point of Level 2, restarting the challenge.

Upon colliding with a heart, Mario's life increases, providing a valuable boost to his overall health. This mechanic adds an element of strategy and allows players to prolong their gameplay by actively seeking out and collecting hearts throughout the game.

As Mario successfully defeats the Goomba, he progresses forward and reaches the next hurdle. Although the hurdle may appear discolored in the screenshot, it is important to note that this is a visual representation and not an actual discoloration within the game itself. This advancement showcases Mario's accomplishments and propels him towards new challenges in the gameplay.

Upon collision with the Goomba in the next hurdle, the level restarts, and Mario is returned to the starting point. However, as Mario successfully eliminates this Goomba, he advances to the next level, showcasing progress and unlocking new gameplay experiences.

Regardless of whether Mario touches the Goomba, he ultimately reaches the end of the current level and proceeds to the next level. In Level 3, players are once again prompted to press the space bar to enter this new level, introducing fresh challenges and opportunities for further gameplay advancement.

In this dynamic gameplay scenario, if the fire from the dragon touches Mario, the level restarts, requiring the player to start again. Meanwhile, the dragon moves back and forth, continuously launching fireballs, creating an ongoing challenge for the player to navigate. Additionally, if Mario touches the Goomba, the level restarts, presenting an added level of difficulty and strategic gameplay.

Upon eliminating all the Goombas, the dragon descends from above. In a critical turn of events, if Mario collides with the dragon, Mario meet their demise. This intensifies the gameplay and adds a thrilling climax to the level.
